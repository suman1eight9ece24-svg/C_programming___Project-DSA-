1. Queue Concept (FIFO)
---------------------------------------------------------------
A Queue follows the rule:
First In → First Out (FIFO)

In this project:
- Normal patients are handled using a simple queue
- Patients are served in the order they arrive

Key variables used:
- front → points to the first patient
- rear  → points to the last patient

Operations:
- Enqueue → add patient at rear
- Dequeue → remove patient from front

2. Emergency Queue (Priority Queue Idea)
---------------------------------------------------------------
Instead:
- Each patient has a priority
- Lower priority number = more critical case

After inserting a patient:
- The emergency list is sorted by priority
- Most critical patient is always served first

This simulates emergency handling in hospitals.

3. Date Function in C
---------------------------------------------------------------
The time.h library is used to access system date.

Important steps:
- time_t t stores current time
- localtime() converts it to readable format

struct tm provides:
- tm_mday  → day
- tm_mon   → month
- tm_year  → year
- tm_wday  → weekday

Used to display:
- Current date
- Current day name


4. Time Function in C
---------------------------------------------------------------
Using the same time.h structure:

Time fields:
- tm_hour → hour
- tm_min  → minute
- tm_sec  → second

Used to show:

- Patient arrival time
- Patient call time

This adds realism and professionalism to the system.
