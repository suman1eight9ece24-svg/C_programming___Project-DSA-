1. Queue in C (Used for BFS)
----------------------------
A Queue follows the FIFO rule:
First In → First Out

In this project:
• A queue is used to implement Breadth First Search (BFS)
• It stores city indices to be visited next
• Helps explore cities level-by-level

Key operations:
• Enqueue → add city index to queue
• Dequeue → remove city index from front

2. Graph Representation (Adjacency Matrix)
------------------------------------------
Cities are represented as nodes.
Routes are represented as edges.

Implementation:
• 2D matrix (adjMatrix)
• adjMatrix[i][j] = 1 means a route exists

Why adjacency matrix:
• Simple to implement
• Fast route existence check
• Suitable for small fixed-size graphs

3. BFS – Shortest Path Algorithm
--------------------------------
Breadth First Search (BFS):
• Explores all neighboring cities first
• Uses a queue internally

In this project BFS is used to:
• Find the shortest path between two cities
• Track the path using a parent array

4. DFS – Route Existence Check
------------------------------
Depth First Search (DFS):
• Explores one path completely before backtracking
• Uses recursion

In this project DFS is used to:
• Check whether any route exists between two cities
• Does not guarantee shortest path

This project demonstrates how basic C concepts can be combined to build real, practical usege. To make this learning part I use AI and also my won word. 
Key difference from BFS:
• DFS checks connectivity
• BFS finds shortest route
