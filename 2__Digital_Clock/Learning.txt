===================== Include<time.h> ===========================
1. What is time.h?

time.h is a standard C library used to work with:

• Current system date
• Current system time
• Time calculations
• Time formatting

It is platform-independent, meaning it works on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

2. Core Data Types in time.h
2.1 time_t
time_t now;


• Stores time as seconds since 1 Jan 1970 (Unix Epoch)
• Used as a raw time value
• Not human-readable directly

Think of it as a timestamp.

2.2 struct tm
struct tm *local;


This structure breaks time into readable parts.

Important fields:

Field	Meaning
tm_sec	Seconds (0–59)
tm_min	Minutes (0–59)
tm_hour	Hours (0–23)
tm_mday	Day of month (1–31)
tm_mon	Month (0–11)
tm_year	Years since 1900

Important correction:

Year = tm_year + 1900
Month = tm_mon + 1

3. Important time.h Functions
3.1 time()
time(&now);


• Fetches the current system time
• Stores it in a time_t variable

3.2 localtime()
local = localtime(&now);


• Converts time_t into local time format
• Returns a pointer to struct tm
• Automatically adjusts for timezone

3.3 Example Flow (Very Important Concept)
System Clock
     ↓
time() → time_t
     ↓
localtime()
     ↓
struct tm (human-readable)


This flow is the correct and standard way to access date & time in C.

4. Why time.h Is Used in Your Program

Your program uses time.h to:

• Display real-time clock
• Show current date
• Update seconds dynamically
• Keep stopwatch accurate

This is the correct professional approach instead of manual calculations.

5. Cross-Platform Compatibility Explained

Different operating systems use different system functions.

Example problem:
• Windows → Sleep()
• Linux/macOS → sleep()

To solve this, conditional compilation is used.

6. Conditional Compilation (#ifdef)
#ifdef _WIN32
#include <windows.h>
#define SLEEP(x) Sleep(x * 1000)
#define CLEAR "cls"
#else
#include <unistd.h>
#define SLEEP(x) sleep(x)
#define CLEAR "clear"
#endif

What this does:

• Detects operating system at compile time
• Uses correct header files
• Uses correct delay function
• Uses correct screen clear command

Result:
👉 One codebase works everywhere

7. Why Macros Are Used (#define)
#define SLEEP(x)
#define CLEAR


Benefits:

• Hides OS-specific details
• Makes code readable
• Avoids rewriting logic
• Improves maintainability

Example:

SLEEP(1);
system(CLEAR);
