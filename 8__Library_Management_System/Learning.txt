1. Binary Search Tree (BST) Concept
-------------------------------------------------------------
A Binary Search Tree follows this rule:

• Left subtree contains smaller keys
• Right subtree contains larger keys
• No duplicate keys allowed

In this project:
• bookID is used as the key
• Books are automatically stored in sorted order
• Searching, inserting, and deleting become efficient

A) BST Node Structure :- Each node represents one book and contains information.
B) Insertion :- Insertion follows BST rules, This ensures the tree remains ordered.
C) Searching :- Search operation to compares bookID.
D) Deletion :- This keeps BST properties intact.
E) Inorder Traversal :- Inorder traversal prints books in sorted order : Left → Root → Right

2. File Handling for Persistence
-------------------------------------------------------------
Data is stored in "Book.txt" using inorder traversal.

Format:
bookID|bookTitle

Features:
• Data is saved before exit
• Data is loaded at program start
• BST is reconstructed from file
