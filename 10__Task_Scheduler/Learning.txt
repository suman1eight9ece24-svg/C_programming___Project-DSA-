--------------------------------------------------
1. Linked List (Task List)
--------------------------------------------------
• All tasks are stored in a singly linked list.
• Each node represents one task with:
  - Task ID
  - Task name
  - Priority
• Linked lists allow:
  - Dynamic memory allocation
  - Easy insertion and deletion of tasks
• This structure represents the main task database.

--------------------------------------------------
2. Stack (Undo Feature)
--------------------------------------------------
• A stack is used to implement the "Undo Last Task" feature.
• Stack follows LIFO (Last In, First Out).
• Whenever a task is added:
  - A copy of the task is pushed onto the stack.
• Undo operation:
  - Pops the last task from the stack
  - Removes the same task from the linked list
• This models real undo behavior in applications.

--------------------------------------------------
3. Queue (Task Processing)
--------------------------------------------------
• A queue is used to process tasks in order.
• Queue follows FIFO (First In, First Out).
• All tasks from the linked list are moved into the queue
  when batch processing starts.
• Tasks are processed one by one from the front of the queue.
• This simulates CPU or job scheduling systems.
