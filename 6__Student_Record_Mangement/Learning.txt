1. Persistent Data Using File Handling
--------------------------------------
This program does not store data only in memory.
Student records are saved permanently using file handling.

Key functions:
- saveToFile()  → writes linked list data into "students.txt"
- loadFromFile() → reads data back when the program starts

Important points:
- fprintf() is used to write structured data to a file
- fscanf() is used to read structured data from a file
- File is updated automatically after:
  - adding a student
  - deleting a student
  - updating CGPA
  - sorting records

2. Auto-Loading Data at Program Start
-------------------------------------
The function loadFromFile() is called before the menu loop starts.

Why this matters:
- Previously saved student data is restored automatically
- Data is not lost when the program is closed
- Program behaves like a small database system

3. Linked List + File Synchronization Strategy
----------------------------------------------

The program uses a dual-storage approach:

- Linked List → main working memory (fast operations)
- File (students.txt) → permanent storage (backup)

Workflow:
- All operations are done on the linked list
- After every modification, saveToFile() is called

Benefits:
- No data loss
- File always remains updated
- Clear separation between memory and storage

4. Reverse Insertion While Loading Data
---------------------------------------

While loading data from the file, new nodes are inserted at the head:

    newNode->next = head;
    head = newNode;

Note:
- The order of records may be reversed in memory
- This trade-off is acceptable for this application

This project demonstrates how basic C concepts can be combined to build real, practical usege. To make this learning part I use AI and also my won word.
